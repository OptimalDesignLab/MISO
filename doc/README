This directory contains Doxygen configuration files for building HTML and LaTeX
documentation of the MACH sources.

If not already available, Doxygen can be downloaded from

   http://www.doxygen.org

We recommend using version 1.8 or later.

To build the documentation, simply type "make" in the doc/ directory. This will
create the file CodeDocumentation.html, which can be viewed in any web browser and LaTeX 
files can be used to create pdf. Both LaTeX and HTML documentation can be found in CodeDocumentation directory.
***
But in case there is addition of new directories, then "CodeDocumentation.conf.in" needs to 
be modified a bit. The option to add input directories can be found around line 752 in the above file.
In addition, there are options to change name, version of the project and EXCLUDE tag can be used to exclude files
that you don't want to include in documentation. 
***
Note: In this case, doxygen configuration file is aviable already but if you want new configuration file;
it can be generated using  "doxygen -g <config_file>" and use doxygen <config_file> to generate documentation. 

Some building considerations:

- To clean the (large) CodeDocumentation/ directory, type "make clean".

- On Mac OS X, the command-line executable "doxygen", required to build the code
  documentation, can be found inside the Doxygen application in

     Doxygen.app/Contents/Resources/doxygen

- The class inheritance and collaboration diagrams in the code documentation use
  the directed graph visualization tool, DOT, which is part of the Graphviz
  package. If not available (e.g. on Mac OS X), Graphviz can be downloaded from

     http://www.graphviz.org

- Formulas in the documentation are rendered using LaTeX. A popular choice for
  TeX typesetting is the TeX Live distribution

     http://www.tug.org/texlive
